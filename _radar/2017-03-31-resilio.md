title: "Resilio"
intro: "Resilio is worth using every day for file synchronization."
appurl: "https://www.resilio.com/"
good: "Well made clients for all platforms. Truly decentralized, updating files directly between devices using the same technology as BitTorrent. Free for individuals, commercial versions for enterprises."
bad: "The source code is closed, meaning it can never be fully trusted. Long term availability and cost may vary due to Resilio's business needs."
future: "Well-funded with a plausible revenue stream, so hopefully will be maintained to current high standard."
