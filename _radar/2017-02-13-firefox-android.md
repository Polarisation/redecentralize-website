title: "Firefox Android"
intro: "Firefox Android is worth using every day as a mobile web browser."
appurl: "https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/android/"
good: "Respects your privacy by protecting you from trackers. Can install plugins, such as advert blockers and video downloaders."
bad: "Some plugins don't work. Some people find it slow on some phones, but it is much better than when you last tried it."
future: "Gradually being rewritten in a safe programming language called Rust to make it more secure. Also, using it supports Mozilla, a rare non-profit which has your back on the web."
