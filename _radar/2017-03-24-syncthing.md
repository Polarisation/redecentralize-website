title: "Syncthing"
intro: "Syncthing is worth trying for file synchronization."
appurl: "https://syncthing.net/"
good: "Sends updates to changed files directly between your devices, no cloud service needed. Flexible, can connect any directory to any directory. Free."
bad: "Installation awkward on desktop. No iOS version at all. Simple but confusing user interface. Sometimes devices can't find each other."
future: "Open source and peer-to-peer, so will stay decentralized. iOS version more likely in the future, as the language Go gets better support for the operating system."
