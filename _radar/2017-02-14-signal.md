intro: "Signal is worth trying as an instant messenger."
appurl: "https://whispersystems.org/"
good: "State of the art encryption for messages and video calls. Good interface and features. Runs on all the important platforms."
bad: "The biggest problem is that message delivery is sometimes unreliable. Also, it depends on central servers at both Apple/Google and Signal."
future: "Whisper Systems has added the same encryption to WhatsApp, bringing it to a billion people. Using Signal supports them to continue leading the way in usable, good encryption."
