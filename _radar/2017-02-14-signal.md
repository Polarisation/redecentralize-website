title: "Signal"
intro: "Signal is worth trying as an instant messenger."
appurl: "https://whispersystems.org/"
good: "State of the art end-to-end encryption for messages and video calls. Good interface and features. Runs on all the important platforms."
bad: "Message delivery is sometimes unreliable. Most importantly, while the encryption decentralizes trust, it isn't truly decentralized as it depends on central servers at both Apple/Google and Signal."
future: "Whisper Systems has added the same encryption to WhatsApp, bringing it to a billion people. Using Signal supports them to continue leading the way in usable, good encryption."
