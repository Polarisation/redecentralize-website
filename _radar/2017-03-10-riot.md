title: "Riot"
intro: "Riot is worth trying as a replacement for group chat and instant messaging."
appurl: "http://riot.im/"
good: "As well as a web interface, it has fairly well made clients on all the main desktop and mobile platforms. Great, this is table stakes, yet so rare!"
bad: "Confirming encryption keys is a bit clunky. However, it's a new feature, and they're working on it."
future: "Riot is built on the <a href='https://matrix.org/'>Matrix platform</a> - so the most exciting thing about it is that if it succeeds, it will also make other apps easier to build."
